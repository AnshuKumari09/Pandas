# 📊 Trader Behavior Insights – Sentiment-Based Trading Analysis

This project is about analyzing how trader behavior changes based on market sentiment like Fear, Greed, etc.

## 🧩 Datasets Used

1. **Hyperliquid Trader Data** – includes trade details like account, execution price, size, side (BUY/SELL), PnL, fee, etc.
2. **Fear & Greed Index Data** – gives daily market sentiment (like Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed)

---

## 🔍 What I tried to understand:

- Which sentiment leads to more profit for traders?
- Is BUY better or SELL during different market moods?
- Do bigger trades give better results?
- Does trader behavior really change based on sentiment?

---

## 📊 Graphs/Visuals I created:

- **Average PnL per Sentiment** (Bar Chart)
- **PnL Trend Over Time** (Monthly & Yearly)
- **PnL by Side & Sentiment** (Box Plot)
- **Trade Proportion by Sentiment** (Pie Chart)
- **Heatmap: Side vs Sentiment vs Avg PnL**
- **Volume of Trades under Each Sentiment**
- **PnL Volatility using Standard Deviation**

---

## 💡 Key Insights:

- Most trades happen during Fear, but Extreme Greed gives higher average profit.
- Side (BUY/SELL) performance depends heavily on sentiment.
- Larger trade sizes carry higher risk and don’t always mean more profit.
- Only a few traders/accounts are consistently profitable – maybe smart traders or bots.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand the link between data and human behavior in trading.  
It’s not just about numbers — it's also about emotions, timing, and strategy.  
Really enjoyed building this and learned how to turn data into useful insights.
